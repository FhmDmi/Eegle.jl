# Tutorial ML 1

[💻 Full Code](@ref "Code for Tutorial ML 1")

The goal of this tutorial is to show how Riemannian machine learning can be done using **Eegle**
in conjunction with package [PosDefManifold.jl](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifoldML.jl). 

As an example, we will compare the *Augmented Covariance Matrices* method proposed in [Carrara2024ACM](@cite) to a state-of-the-art benchmark by means of cross-validations (8-fold by default) on the [`EXAMPLE_MI_1`](@ref) Motor Imagery (MI) [BCI](@ref "Acronyms") EEG file provided with **Eegle**. 

For this example, we will use trials pertaining to classes "feet" and "right_hand".

!!! info
    The benchmark method is the standard minimum distance to mean (MDM) Riemannian classifier adopting the affine-invariant metric (default in **Eegle**) [barachant2012multi](@cite). The classifier will be applied on sample covariance matrices (`covtype = SCM`) after the following pre-processing:
    1. resampling the data from 256 to 128 samples per second (`rate = 1//2`)
    2. filtering the EEG data in the band-pass region 8-32 Hz (`bandPass = (8, 32)`)
    3. rejecting trials featuring abnormal amplitude (`upperLimit = 1`). 

First, let us perform the cross validation for the MDM classifier:

```julia
using Eegle

args = (bandPass = (8, 32), upperLimit = 1, rate = 1//2, classes=["feet", "right_hand"]);
cvMDM = crval(EXAMPLE_MI_1; covtype = SCM, args...) # or Eegle.crval(EXAMPLE_MI_1)
```

`cvMDM` will be a [CVres](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifoldML.jl/stable/cv/#PosDefManifoldML.CVres) structure holding detailed results of the cross-validation:

```

The average balanced accuracy across fold is given in the .avgAcc field (0.792).

Then, let us perform the cross validation for the ACM method.

!!! warning
    ACM are obtained stacking to the EEG trials lagged versions of them before computing the sample covariance matrices. ACMs computed this way have each side of size *n × l*, where *n* is the number of electrodes and *l* is the number of lags, thus may become very large and, typically, are no longer positive-definite. Therefore, we will apply a Tikhonov regularization and a dimensionality-reduction retaining 99.9% of the explained variance (eVar=0.999). This is achieved passing a `Pipeline` object — see [here](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifoldML.jl/stable/conditioners/). Everything else in the ACM method is the same as per the benchmark classifier.

!!! note
    ACMs encode not only the spatial distribution of brain dipolar sources, but also the *cross-covariance* between them for the embedded lags. Since after resampling the sampling rate of the data is 128, each EEG sample is spaced apart 1/128 = 7.8125 ms. We wll embed 10 lags (lags=10), thus we will be able to encode cross-covariance information up to 7.8125 * 10 = 78.125 ms. 

```julia
pipeline = @→ Tikhonov(1e-4) Recenter(Fisher; eVar=0.999, verbose=false) 
cvACM = crval(EXAMPLE_MI_1; pipeline, lags=10, covtype = SCM, args...) 
```

*Output you will see:*

```

The average accuracy across folds has raised from 0.792 to 0.885 with the settings we have used.

!!! tip
    The effective dimension of covariance matrices in each fold after lag embedding and dimensionality reduction by recentering is given in field `.matSizes`. Notice that the sizes are not necessarily equal to *n × l*, nor they must be equal across folds, because of the dimensionality reduction operated by the [Recenter](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifoldML.jl/stable/conditioners/#PosDefManifoldML.Recenter) conditioner.

Finally, let us compare the classification accuracy performance of the two methods employing the
[testCV](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifoldML.jl/stable/stats_inferential/#PosDefManifoldML.testCV) function:

```julia
z, p, ase = testCV(cvMDM, cvACM)
```
*Output you will see:*
```REPL
(1.2579418040663017, 0.20841280368414866, 0.4031128874149275)
```

The test yields a z-value of 1.258 with asymptotic standard error of 0.403, resulting in 
a p-value equal to 0.208. We therefore do not reject the null hypothesis of statistical equivalence 
of the accuracy classification performance obtained by the two classification methods.

---

Now, let us appreciate what the function [`crval`](@ref) does for us by performing the cross-validation in a step-by-step manner:

**a** - load the data:
```julia
o = readNY(EXAMPLE_MI_1; args...)
```

**b** - encode the EEG trials, which are stored in o.trials, as covariance matrices:
```julia
C = covmat(o.trials; covtype = SCM)
Cl = covmat(o.trials; covtype = SCM, lags = 10)
```

**c** - call the `crval` function of package [PosDefManifoldML](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifoldML.jl):
```julia
cvMDM2 = crval(MDM(), C, o.y)
cvACM2 = crval(MDM(), Cl, o.y; pipeline) 
# in julia, `pipeline` is the same as `pipeline=pipeline`
```

The results are identical. Let us verify:
```julia
cvMDM.avgAcc == cvMDM2.avgAcc # must be true
cvACM.avgAcc == cvACM2.avgAcc # must be true
```
