# Example Data

**Eegle** deploys example EEG data files in [NY format](@ref) to be used in examples and tutorials.
This format is read by fucntion [`readNY`](@ref), which creates an [`EEG`](@ref) structure including both the data and metadata. 
The complete path to the file is is accessible anywhere as Eegle.{CONSTANT},
where {CONSTANT} is one of the heading here below. See the [tutorials](@ref "Tutorials").

## `EXAMPLE_Normative_1`

Eyes-close resting-state continuous EEG recording acquired on a 20yo healthy woman:
- amplifier: *Mitsar-EEG-201* (Mitsar Co. Ltd., St. Petersburg, Russia)
- channels: 19 standard Ag/AgCl electrodes (10-20 international system)
- sampling rate: 128 samples per second
